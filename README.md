### About Notepad Sharp

Let's be honest.
<br>
Before Windows 11, Notepad wasn't the most visually appealing. It's bland, ___ and it doesn't have a dark mode.
<br>
So I decided to write a modern plain text editor for Windows.
<br>
Notepad although simple is very useful.
So I wanted to make something easy to use and appealing to all types of users.
